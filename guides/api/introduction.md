description: Overview of the StatusCake API

The StatusCake API is organised around the features that we offer, with each
feature providing a set of endpoints to perform operations on resources
associated with your account.

The documentation for the available endpoints along with their respective
parameters, and responses may be found [here](/api).

The remainder of this section focusses on ancillary documentation supporting the
functionality of the API, concerned primarily with authentication, ratelimiting
and error handling.

## Next Steps

The following references describe how to get started using the API and avoid
some common mistakes.
